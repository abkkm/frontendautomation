streams, parallelstream

Botha are used to process grp of objects.

sequencial stream - it executes in a single core of machine in sequencial flow
parallel stream - all threads use multiple core 

for read operation - we can use parallel stream
But for write operation - we use sequential stream to maintain data consistency

flow of exection is sequential stream

CompleteableFuture - It is used for asynchronous programming

Future - jdk 1.5
